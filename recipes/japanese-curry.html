            <li>2 onions</li>
            <li>2 carrots</li>
            <li>2-3 potatoes (I personally use russet, but gold waxy are suggested)</li>
            <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>4 servings cooked white rice</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>For the Curry Sauce</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 Tbsp neutral oil (for cooking)</li>
            <li>1/2 Japanese Curry Roux box</li>
            <li>2 cups chicken stock/broth</li>
            <li>1/2 Tbsp Honey (optional)</li>
            <li>1/2 Tbsp Soy Sauce (optional)</li>
            <li>1/2 Tbsp Ketchup (optional)</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <h4>Prepping ingredients</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Peel <b>3 potatoes</b> and cut them into quarters or 6 pieces depending on size. 
                Soak them in water for 15 minutes to remove excess starch.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cut <b>2 onions</b> into wedges. 
                If you prefer, you can mince or thinly slice the onions.
            </li>
            <li>
                Peel <b>2 carrots</b> and cut them into rolling wedges; 
                cut at a 45 degree angle, roll 90 degrees, and cut again. 
                This creates more surface area for more flavor and faster cooking.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cut off the extra fat from the <b>boneless, skinless chicken thighs</b> and discard it.
                Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces. Season with ground black pepper.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>To Cook the Curry</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat <b>neutral oil</b> in a large pot over medium heat and add the onion</li>
            <li>
                Saute the onions, stirring occasionally, until they become translucent and tender, about 5 minutes.
                Do not stir too often because they won't develop a golden color.
                If you have extra time, saute for an additional 5 minutes for more color and flavor.
            </li>
            <li>Add the <b>minced garlic</b> and <b>grated ginger</b>. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken and cook, stirring frequently, until it's no longer pink.</li>
            <li>Add <b>2 cups chicken stock/broth</b>.</li>
            <li>Add the <b>1/2 Tbsp Honey</b>, <b>1/2 Tbsp Soy Sauce</b>, and <b>1/2 Tbsp Ketchup</b> if desired. </li>
            <li>Add the carrots and potatoes. The broth should barely cover the ingredients.</li>
            <li>
                Simmer, covered*, on medium-low heat for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
                *Simmer uncovered if the ingredients are completely submerged in the broth.
            </li>
            <li>Once boiling, use a fine-mesh strainer to skim the scum and foam from the surface of the broth.</li>
            <li>Cook until you can skewer the carrots and potatoes with a fork.</li>
            <li>
                Turn off the heat. From the <b>1/2 package Japanese curry roux</b>, 
                put 1-2 cubes into a ladleful of cooking liquid. Let it dissolve by stirring in the ladle 
                with a spoon or chopsticks. Stir into the pot to incorporate. Repeat with the rest of the blocks.
            </li>
            <li> Simmer, uncovered, on medium-low heat, stirring frequenntly, until the curry becomes thick. 5-10 minutes. </li>
        </ol>
