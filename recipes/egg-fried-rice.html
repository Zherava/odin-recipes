        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Cook 1 1/2 cups white jasmine rice and lay on a sheet tray uncovered. 
                Place the rice in the fridge for 24-48 hours until dried out.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a large wok or pan over medium high heat, add 2 tbsp of avocado oil 
                to the pan and stir fry the scallion whites, garlic and ginger for 15 seconds. 
                Turn the heat to high and add the frozen veggies and cook for 1-2 minutes until 
                the vegetables are cooked through.
            </li>
            <li>
                Move the veggies to the side of your pan with a spatula and add another 
                1/2 tbsp of oil to the bare side of the pan. Add the beaten eggs and 
                scramble until about 80% cooked.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the rice and mix for 1-2 minutes until combined. Add the soy sauce, 
                white pepper, sugar, salt, and msg and continue cooking and mixing for 
                another 1-2 minutes until rice is combined and looks dry. Taste and 
                adjust seasoning to your preference. Add the scallion greens and sesame oil, 
                give the rice a final mix and enjoy!
