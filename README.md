This is a beginning project to demonstrate my understanding of basic HTML. \
I have used created base boilerplates for each page and supplied each one with content including headers, images, emphasized and bolded text, as well as ordered and unordered lists. I have also included links to each page using anchors and hyperlink references, and kept my files organized in the main repository.
